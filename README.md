### Hi! I'm Daven ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a second year student at the University of British Columbia, currently working towards a bachelor of science in Computer Science. On my GitHub, you'll find projects that I've finished or am currently working on. I'm proficient in Java but I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My current obsession is learning all that has C++ has to offer (painful, I know). Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenfroberg/) and send me a message!
