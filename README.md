### Hi! I'm Daven ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm an incoming third year student at the University of British Columbia and software engineer for Sun Machine Games, currently working towards a bachelor of science in Computer Science. On my GitHub, you'll find projects that I've finished or am currently working on. I'm proficient in Java and C++ but I am also familiar with Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. My current obsession is learning all that has Python has to offer and to (hopefully) make some cool stuff with it! Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenfroberg/) and send me a message!
