### Hi! I'm Daven ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia currently working towards a Bachelor of Science.

On my GitHub, you'll find projects that I've finished or am currently working on. I'm proficient in Java, C++, and Python but I am also familiar with C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My current obsession is learning all that has Python has to offer and to (hopefully) make some cool stuff with it! 

Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenfroberg/) and send me a message!
