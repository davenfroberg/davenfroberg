### Hi! I'm Daven ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia currently working towards a Bachelor of Science.

You can explore my GitHub to discover projects I've completed or am actively developing. I'm most familiar with Python, Java, TypeScript, and SQL, but I'm also proficient in C/C++, HTML, and CSS. Lately, I've been exploring fullstack web development, creating in-depth projects to help furhter my skills!
